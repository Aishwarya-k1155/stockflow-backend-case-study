# StockFlow – Backend Engineering Intern Case Study

This repository contains my solution for the Backend Engineering Intern case study at Bynry.

## Overview
The case study evaluates backend engineering fundamentals such as:
- Debugging and code review
- Database schema design
- API design and edge case handling
- Working with incomplete requirements

The focus of this submission is on clarity of thought, correctness, and real world backend considerations rather than production ready implementation.

## Structure
- Part 1: Code Review & Debugging
- Part 2: Database Design
- Part 3: Low Stock Alerts API

Each section includes:
- Identified issues or assumptions
- Impact analysis
- Design or implementation decisions
- Edge cases and scalability considerations

## Notes
Some assumptions were made due to incomplete requirements and are explicitly documented in each section.
